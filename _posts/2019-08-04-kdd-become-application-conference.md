It's that time of the year when a major data conference conference opens and [releases the papers to the public](https://www.kdd.org/kdd2019/proceedings), so it's time to check what are the hot topics this year.<br>
<br>
I extracted the keywords from the abstracts of all accepted papers in KDD 19 with their frequencies.

1. Graph and Network Embedding are dominant in KDD; the networks are mostly heterogeneous network; knowledge graph track is growing
<br />
2. Deep models have been necessary for machine learning tasks
<br />
3. Search, recommendation, ranking are still the core of KDD
<br />
4. KDD cares more about real-world problems (similar to WWW?) and online learning is one application
<br />
5. Some hot topic: temporal data processing, anomaly data understanding, reinforcement learning, adversarial learning, multi-task learning (whatâ€™s the difference from ICML?)
<br />
6. Natural language processing tools are prevailing such as embedding methods and deep language models
<br />
7. The models are better to be large-scale, end-to-end and interpretable; framework or system might be preferable than an individual model
<br />
8. Some hot domains: news, advertising, traffic, stock and social network
<br />
9. Some basic deep models to use: convolutional and recurrent networks, attention mechanisms

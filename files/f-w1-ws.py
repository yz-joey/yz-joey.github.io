# 1. Implement the function 'square' that takes an input and returns the square
# of the input.
#    Example: input: 2
#             return value: 4
def square(input):
	return input ** 2
	return input * input
	return pow(input, 2)

# 2. Implement a function differenceOfSquares that takes two input numbers and
# returns the difference of their squares. Make use of square function that you
# have already written.
# Example: input : n1 = 3, n2 = 2
#          return value : 5
def differenceOfSquares(n1, n2):
	return square(n1) - square(n2)

# 3. Implement function simpleInterest that takes as input principle p, rate r
# (in %) and time t and returns the interest value.
#   Example In : p = 3100.00, r = 7, t =1
#           Out : 'Simple Interest = 217.00'
#   Hint : Please lookup the formula for simple interest
# Interest = p*r*t/100
def simpleInterest(p, r, t):
	return (p * r * t) / 100

# 4. In digital electronics, a NAND gate (NOT-AND) is a logic gate which
# produces an output which is False if and only if all its inputs are True.
# Implement the 'nand' function using the 'and', 'or', and 'not' built-in
# Python functions.
# Example:
#        nand(True, False) outputs True
#        nand(False, False) outputs True
#        nand(True, True) outputs False

# input   |   output
# 1   1   |   0
# 1   0   |   1
# 0   1   |   1
# 0   0   |   1
def nand_integer(a, b): 
	return 1 - a * b

def nand_boolean(a, b): 
	return not (a and b)

def nand_boolean_2(a, b):
	return not a or not b


# 5. Write a function checkends(s), which takes in a string s and returns True
# if and only if the first character in s is the same as the last character in
# s. The checkends function does not have to work on the empty string (the
# string '').
# Example: In: s = 'hah! a match'
#          Out: True
#          In: s = 'not a match'
#          Out: False
def checkends(s):
	# assume s is not empty
	return s[0] == s[-1]

# 6. Write the function palindrome(s) that checks if a string of exactly length
# 4 is a palindrome (the same forwards as it is when the order is reversed).
# Example: In: s = 'lool'
#          Out: True
#          In: "UCLA"
#          Out: False
# Please use your checkends function.
def palindrome(s):
	# assume s has length 4
	return s[0] == s[3] and s[1] == s[2]

def palindrome_2(s):â€¨	
	return s == s[-1::-1]

# High-level trick (not necessary now!)
# s[a:b:c]
# a is the start, b is the end, c is the step.
# in s[a:b], the second : is hidden and c is default as 1. 


# 7. Write convertFromSeconds(s), which takes in a nonnegative integer number
# of seconds s and returns a list (we'll call it L) of four nonnegative
# integers that represents that number of seconds in more conventional units of
# time, such that:
# L[0] element represents the number of days
# L[1] represents the number of hours
# L[2] represents the number of minutes
# L[3] represents the number of seconds
# Example: In: s = 99999
#          Out: [1, 3, 46, 39]
#
# For this problem you will need both the modulo operator '%' (which we saw in
# class) and the new "floor division" operator '//'. The floor division
# 'a // b' gives us the greatest integer k such that b*k <= a. For instance,
# 12 // 5 = 2 because 2*5 < 12, but 3*5 > 12. Play with this operator to get a feel
# for it.
def convertFromSeconds(s):
	days = s // (24*60*60) 
	s = s % (24*60*60)
	hours = s // (60*60)
	s = s % (60*60)
	minutes = s // 60
	seconds = s % 60
	result = [days, hours, minutes, seconds]
	return result

<b>About me:</b><br>
<a href="{{ site.url }}/files/CV.pdf" target="_blank">[CV]</a>
<br>
I am a fifth-year Ph.D student in <a href="https://scai.cs.ucla.edu/" target="_blank">Scalable Analytics Institute (ScAi)</a>, Department of Computer Science at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) advised by <a href="http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~weiwang/" target="_blank"> Dr. Wei Wang</a>. My research interests focus on natural language processing and text mining. Currently, I am working on Low-resource Information Extraction from different domains, such as figurative language, clinical case reports and semi-structured web pages.
